# Bird Personalities Analysis: Exploring Cardinal Traits through Clustering and PCA

## Description
This repository contains code and results from an analysis aimed at understanding the personality types of northern cardinals based on environmental factors using clustering and principal component analysis (PCA)

## Scenario Questions
Used the dataset to answer the following questions:
1. What variables seem the most useful for separating out the clusters with the personality column?
2. Does a PCA seem to line up with either the grouping variable or the clusters?

## Additional Considerations: 
- The dataset contains unnecessary information, so filtering and selection of relevant data points are crucial so I have provided thorough explanations and summaries in my python code and detailed PDF report.
  
## Project Steps:
1. Perform data preprocessing and data cleaning of the Angry birds(Cardinal Personality) dataset.
2. Convert all categorical objects to numeric to make the dataset ready for K-means clustering.
3. Perform K-means clustering with K=3 as there are 3 personality grouping variables that need to be compared.
4. Perform visualization on the result obtained after clustering.
5. Normalize the dataset to perform Principal component analysis(PCA).
6. Finally, develop an appropriate plot for data visualization.
7. Add interpretation results.

## Expected Output:
1. Generate one clustering plot and one PCA plot answering the questions.
2. Prepare final pdf report with relevant visual plots and python code snippet.

## Tools Used:
- Python for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Google colabs, an online platform for Jupyter notebooks that offers free GPU and TPU resources, making it ideal for data-intensive tasks and machine learning experiments.
